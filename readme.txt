Ms Post Type Shortcode is a very lightweight plugin that helps to display posts in a grid, slider, or with pagination.

== Description ==
The main purpose of this plugin is to display custom post type posts as well as default posts in a grid, slider, or with pagination. There are three types of shortcodes available in the plugin, each with some common and different parameters. This plugin also has grid, slider, and pagination design settings available and is very easy to use.
